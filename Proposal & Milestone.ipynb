    "My client is SumOfUs.org, an corporate watchdog group that uses digital campaigns (largely digital petitions) to demand corporate accountibility on environmental and human rights issues.  As a large, multi-issue campaigning organization, they often have to make hard choices about which campaigns they can pursue.  New members typically join the organization by signing a petition.  Some petitions are good at driving new growth, such as a petition to save the whales at Seaworld.  While many new members joined on that petition, most of them were not interested in the core mission of SumOfUs, and had poor engagement and donation rates at 90 days after joining.  SumOfUs ran another campaign at the same on corporate lobbying legislation.  Few new members joined from that campaign, but the ones that did had very high engagement and donation rates.\n",
